I am an Assistant Manager at the <a href="https://www.aai.aero/"> Airports Authority of India (AAI)</a>, where I specialize in empirical economic analysis. My previous experience includes a consulting role at the Industrial Statistical Unit within the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov.in/"> Ministry of Commerce and Industries</a>, where I focused on analyzing trends in the Index of Industrial Production and related policies. Before that, I served as a Teaching Associate at the <a href="https://www.lbsnaa.gov.in/"> Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration</a> and worked as a Research Assistant for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/deepti-goel/home"> Dr. Deepti Goel</a> at the <a href="http://econdse.org/"> Delhi School of Economics</a>. I hold a Master’s degree from  <a href="https://snu.edu.in/"> Shiv Nadar University</a>  and a Bachelor’s in Economics (Hons.) from <a href="https://www.du.ac.in/"> Delhi University</a>, which provided me with a strong foundation in economic principles. 

My current responsibilities at AAI involve forecasting passenger traffic, assessing the capacity of terminal buildings in airports, and analyzing customer satisfaction surveys across 60+ airports. Additionally, I collaborate with third-party vendors to evaluate their performance. Committed to continuous learning, I have earned multiple certifications in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, aiming to expand my skill set and further enhance my contributions in the field.
