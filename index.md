I am an Assistant Manager at the <a href="https://www.aai.aero/"> Airports Authority of India (AAI)</a>, where I specialize in empirical economic analysis. My previous experience includes a consulting role at the Industrial Statistical Unit within the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, where I focused on analyzing trends in the Index of Industrial Production and related policies. Before that, I served as a Teaching Associate at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration and worked as a Research Assistant for Dr. Deepti Goel at the Delhi School of Economics. I hold a Master’s degree from Shiv Nadar University and a Bachelor’s in Economics (Hons.) from Delhi University, which provided me with a strong foundation in economic principles. My current responsibilities at AAI involve forecasting passenger traffic, assessing the capacity of terminal buildings in airports, and analyzing customer satisfaction surveys across 60+ airports. Additionally, I collaborate with third-party vendors to evaluate their performance. Committed to continuous learning, I have earned multiple certifications in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, aiming to expand my skill set and further enhance my contributions in the field.
